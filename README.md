<h1>Unit 3 Final Project: Project Physical Temple Run Te</h1>

<strong>Interaction</strong>: I will use the Maki Maki for this game.

<strong>Description</strong>: This will be an interactive game where I will use the maki maki to remake the game temple run. I will use the maki maki by making places where players have to stand in order for the person on the screen to jump or duck avoiding obstacles.
